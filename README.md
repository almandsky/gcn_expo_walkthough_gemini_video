# Introduction

In order to know what are the companies attending the Google Cloud Next 2024 Expo, I decided to walk through all of the booths and record it by video.  It toke me 46 minutes to walk by all of the 200+ booths.

I converted the video to 480p, and use Gemini 1.5 pro to process 46 minutes video for 1 frame per second.
